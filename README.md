[![N|Solid](/screenshot.png)]("a")

dirwin.py is a way to navigate and display window layouts while preserving the z buffer.

# Basic usuage:
- ./dirwin.py list # Show current window layout as ascii
- ./dirwin.py left  # focus window to the left of this one

# Directional movement:
- Directional movement is a pretty useful feature in dynamic and tiling window managers, if like me you still prefer WM's like Openbox this script is a way to get that functionality.

# Dependencies:
The following binaries must be in your path:
- xprop
- xwininfo
- wmctrl
